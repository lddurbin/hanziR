# hanziR

> A minimal R package for managing Chinese character (Hanzi) learning cards from the terminal

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Overview

`hanziR` provides a pure terminal workflow for managing Hanzi (Chinese character) flashcards. It uses a YAML file as the source of truth and includes accessible tone cues (shapes + patterns + color names) for learners who are color blind.

## Features

- üìù **YAML-based**: Simple, human-readable source of truth (`cards.yaml`)
- üéØ **Terminal-first**: Complete workflow without leaving the command line
- ‚ôø **Accessible**: Tone representation using shapes, patterns, AND colors
- üé¨ **Mnemonic System**: Hanzi Movie Method integration for memorable character learning
- üìä **Multiple exports**: Markdown, CSV, and Anki TSV formats
- üîç **Powerful filtering**: Search by initial, final, tone, component, or tag
- üìà **Statistics**: Track your collection and progress
- üîÑ **Backward Compatible**: v1.0 cards work seamlessly with v2.0 mnemonic features

## Installation

```r
# Install from GitHub
devtools::install_github("lddurbin/hanziR")

# Or install development version from source
devtools::install()
```

### Making the CLI Available

After installation, make the `hanzi` command available in your terminal:

```bash
# Add to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
export PATH="$PATH:$(Rscript -e 'cat(system.file("bin", package="hanziR"))')"

# Or create a symbolic link
sudo ln -s "$(Rscript -e 'cat(system.file("bin", package="hanziR"))')/hanzi" /usr/local/bin/hanzi
```

Reload your shell or run `source ~/.zshrc` to apply changes.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize a new collection (creates cards.yaml + config.yaml)
hanzi init

# Add a card interactively
hanzi add

# List all cards
hanzi list

# Show details for a specific character
hanzi show Â•Ω

# Search across all fields
hanzi search greeting

# Filter by criteria
hanzi filter --tag HSK1
hanzi filter --tone 3 --initial h

# Export to various formats
hanzi export md --out docs/
hanzi export csv
hanzi export tsv  # Anki-compatible

# View statistics
hanzi stats

# Validate your cards.yaml
hanzi validate
```

## Hanzi Movie Method (Mnemonic System)

`hanziR` v2.0+ supports the **Hanzi Movie Method** from Mandarin Blueprint, a powerful mnemonic technique for memorizing Chinese characters using mental "movies."

### Configuration Commands

Manage your personal mnemonic system with `hanzi config`:

```bash
# Initialize config with default actors/sets/rooms
hanzi config init

# View entire configuration
hanzi config show

# View specific sections
hanzi config show actors
hanzi config show sets
hanzi config show rooms
hanzi config show props

# Validate configuration
hanzi config validate

# Customize your system
hanzi config set actor sh "Sean Connery"
hanzi config set set -ao "Mountain Cabin"
hanzi config set room 3 "Bedroom"
hanzi config set prop Â•≥ "Woman"
```

### Core Components

Each character can have a mnemonic story built from:

1. **Actor** - Person associated with the Pinyin initial (e.g., "sh-" ‚Üí Sean Connery)
2. **Set** - Location associated with the Pinyin final (e.g., "-ao" ‚Üí Mountain Cabin)
3. **Room** - Specific location within the set for the tone (e.g., Tone 3 ‚Üí Bedroom)
4. **Props** - Character components with mnemonic meanings (e.g., "Â•≥" ‚Üí Woman)
5. **Scene** - The full mnemonic story combining all elements

### Configuration

Your personal mnemonic system is stored in `config.yaml` alongside `cards.yaml`:

```yaml
mnemonic_system:
  actors:
    h-: "Hugh Jackman"
    sh-: "Sean Connery"
    # ... customize all 23 initials
    
  sets:
    -ao: "Mountain Cabin"
    -i: "Beach House"
    √ò: "Childhood Home"  # null final
    # ... exactly 13 sets for 13 finals
    
  rooms_by_tone:
    1: "Outside the Entrance"
    2: "Kitchen"
    3: "Bedroom"
    4: "Bathroom"
    5: "On the Roof"
    
  props:
    Â•≥: "Woman"
    Â≠ê: "Child"
    # ... add as you learn
```

### Using R Functions

```r
library(hanziR)

# Read configuration
config <- read_config()

# Get mnemonic elements
get_actor("sh", config)  # "Sean Connery"
get_set("ao", config)    # "Mountain Cabin"
get_room(3, config)      # "Bedroom"
get_prop("Â•≥", config)   # "Woman"
```

### Backward Compatibility

- ‚úÖ All mnemonic fields are **optional**
- ‚úÖ v1.0 cards work perfectly without modification
- ‚úÖ Add mnemonic info gradually as you learn
- ‚úÖ Mix v1.0 and v2.0 cards in the same file

## Accessible Tone System

Mandarin Chinese has 5 tones. To ensure accessibility for color-blind users, each tone is represented with:

| Tone | Name    | Shape   | Pattern | Description        |
|------|---------|---------|---------|---------------------|
| 1    | First   | flat    | `---`   | High level         |
| 2    | Second  | rise    | `/`     | Rising             |
| 3    | Third   | dip     | `\/`    | Dip then rise      |
| 4    | Fourth  | fall    | `\`     | Falling            |
| 5    | Neutral | neutral | `.`     | Light/neutral tone |

Example output: "Â•Ω (h«éo) - Tone 3 (dip \\/)"

## Commands

### `hanzi init`
Initialize a new `cards.yaml` file with example cards.

### `hanzi add`
Interactively add a new card with prompts for all fields.

### `hanzi list`
Display all cards in a compact table format.

### `hanzi show <char>`

### `hanzi search <query...>`
Full-text search across all fields (character, pinyin, meaning, examples, notes, tags).

### `hanzi filter [options]`
Filter cards by specific criteria:
- `--initial <value>`: Filter by initial consonant
- `--final <value>`: Filter by final vowel sound
- `--tone <1-5>`: Filter by tone number
- `--component <char>`: Filter by component character
- `--tag <tag>`: Filter by tag (e.g., HSK1, common)

### `hanzi export <format> [--out <dir>]`
Export cards to different formats:
- `md`: Markdown files (one per card + index)
- `csv`: Single CSV file
- `tsv`: Anki-compatible two-column format (Front/Back)

### `hanzi stats`
Display statistics about your card collection.

### `hanzi validate`

## Data Structure

### v2.0 Format (with optional mnemonic fields)

Cards are stored in `cards.yaml`:

```yaml
version: "2.0"
created: "2025-10-14"
cards:
  - char: "Â•Ω"
    pinyin: "h«éo"
    tone: 3
    tone_shape: "dip"
    tone_pattern: "\\/"
    initial: "h"
    final: "ao"
    
    # Standard fields
    meaning: "good, well, fine"
    keyword: "good"  # Optional: simpler mnemonic keyword
    example: "‰Ω†Â•Ω (n«ê h«éo) - hello"
    tags: ["HSK1", "common", "greeting"]
    notes: "One of the most common characters"
    added: "2025-10-14T10:30:00Z"
    
    # Enhanced components - supports both formats:
    components:
      - char: "Â•≥"
        meaning: "Woman"  # v2.0: object with meaning
      - char: "Â≠ê"
        meaning: "Child"
    # OR simple format: components: ["Â•≥", "Â≠ê"]  # v1.0 still works!
    
    # Mnemonic system (completely optional)
    mnemonic:
      actor: "Hugh Jackman"     # Based on initial "h"
      set: "Mountain Cabin"      # Based on final "ao"
      room: "Bedroom"            # Based on tone 3
      scene: |
        Hugh Jackman walks into the bedroom of my mountain cabin,
        holding a woman and child by the hand. He smiles warmly and
        says "This is GOOD - family is what matters most."
```

### v1.0 Format (still fully supported)

```yaml
version: "1.0"
created: "2025-10-14"
cards:
  - char: "Â•Ω"
    pinyin: "h«éo"
    tone: 3
    tone_shape: "dip"
    tone_pattern: "\\/"
    initial: "h"
    final: "ao"
    components: ["Â•≥", "Â≠ê"]
    meaning: "good, well"
    example: "‰Ω†Â•Ω (n«ê h«éo) - hello"
    tags: ["HSK1", "common", "greeting"]
    notes: "One of the most common characters"
    added: "2025-10-14T10:30:00Z"
```
